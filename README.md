Fine. Here.

### Homework One

[Top](#table-of-contents)

The index page at the bottom of my folder structure contains the required video. As seen below:

It features CSS for both the playing of the video and the menu bar. These are heavily borrowed from w3Schools, as I am in no way familar with CSS or Html at all.
However, I was able to find information on how to do the required things and believe the results are very fine.

The menu bar is also some CSS magic and allows navigation of the pages. 5 pages in total are accessible from the main index.html
Clicking on a page will direct the user up one directory in the bucket, but I've managed to find the right "code" to allow the traverse of this in html. 
Thankfully it is remarkably similar to basic linux directory movement.
 
### Simple layout
[Top](#table-of-contents)

Below is an example of the additional pages. There are 4 of these that are more or less the same in general layout. Some feature an iframe, which shows a website (all wikipedia pages) most for humor value.

Linking of all pages (other than the index) is done via a CSS menu bar.

Do not forget to check the right justified "About" page. This is further linked on the index page to make counting my pages easier. 

### Structure on S3

[Top](#table-of-contents)

This is all hosted on Amazon S3 per the requirement. 
Below shows the structure for the bucket and the name.

### IAM

[Top](#table-of-contents)

Below is my IAM policy. I think I may change this since it may not be a fantastic idea to allow a delete/create on user I put out there on the net. Oops. Good thing this is a classroom environment!

### Cloudfront

[Top](#table-of-contents)

This part I must have missed initially. Since a great deal of what I have typed here is to justifiy the table of contents lets add some pork. Or Goat. Whatever.

This has been a deploying for over 5 minutes. Which is surprising given that the total uncompressed size is ~5 meg. Ahh! Finished!

Only a day late. Since it's the 13th here. Amazon is always late, but intends to arrive precisely when it means to.


### Goats

 # __Yes__. And they really are The Greatest Of All Time.
